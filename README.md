# Hotel-Management-Software
We used C++ on Qt to complete the software development, including the main front of the development process and background of the establishment and maintenance of the database. 
The software contained 7 main modules, including database, layout, time counting, check-in, check-out, statistics and document modules. 
The final version of our Hotel Management System provided guestroom management, booking management, food & beverage management, financial management and information inquiry. 
The interface of the system can show all guestroomsâ€™ distribution plan and indicate the reservation situation.
